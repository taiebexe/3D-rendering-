# 3D Viewer Project

A simple 3D Viewer implemented in Java. This project includes rotation, transformation, and basic rasterization for rendering 3D triangles.

## Features

* Rotate objects using horizontal and vertical sliders.
* Apply transformations using matrix multiplication.
* Basic triangle rasterization with color filling.

## Requirements

* Java 8 or higher
* Java Swing and AWT libraries

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
